React has easily become one of the most popular fron-end javscript library tool sets over the past few years, this may lead you to ask why there are so many 3rd party frameworks for building react app. We will dive into a few of the key reasons most who build apps with react choose to build them with other frameworks, rather than just customizing a generic react app out of the box.

- **Structure and Scalbility** having the ability to scale and add new libraries and continue to scale, along with having better structures within the project is why many adopt Frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, React Bootstrap, and, Create React App.
- **Faster Data Fetching and Caching** some of the advanced Frameworks like Next.js provide built-in caching and ability to load data client side/server side or any combination very easily, thus making for a much faster application.

These are a few reasons most choose some of the great frameworks that are out there for building React applications but there are many more to discuss, stay tuned!
